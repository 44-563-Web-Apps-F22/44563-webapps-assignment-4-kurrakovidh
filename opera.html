    <h3>THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE OR THE SLAVE OF DUTY</h3>

    <h5>
        ACT I
          Scene - A rocky seashore on the coast of Cornwall.  In the
          distance is a calm sea, on which a schooner is lying at anchor.
          Rock L. sloping down to L.C. of stage.  Under these rocks is a
          cavern, the entrance to which is seen at first entrance L.  A
          natural arch of rock occupies the R.C. of the stage.  As the
          curtain rises groups of pirates are discovered — some drinking,
          some playing cards.  SAMUEL, the Pirate Lieutenant, is going from
          one group to another, filling the cups from a flask.  FREDERIC is
          seated in a despondent attitude at the back of the scene. RUTH
          kneels at his feet. </h5>

         
          ALL:  Pour, O pour the pirate sherry; Fill, O fill the pirate glass; And, to make us more than merry Let the pirate bumper pass.
          
         <br>       

         SAMUEL:   For today our pirate 'prentice Rises from indentures freed; Strong his arm, and keen his scent is He's a pirate now indeed!
         
         <br>
         
         ALL:   Here's good luck to Fred'ric's ventures! Fred'ric's out of his indentures. 
         
         <br>
         
         SAMUEL:   Two and twenty, now he's rising, And alone he's fit to fly,  Which we're bent on signalizing With unusual revelry.
         
         <br>       

         ALL:  Here's good luck to Fred'ric's ventures! Fred'ric's out of his indentures. Pour, O pour the pirate sherry; 
               Fill, O fill the pirate glass And, to make us more than merry Let the pirate bumper pass.
         
         <br>
         
         (FREDERIC rises and comes forward with PIRATE KING, who enters)
         
         <br>
         
         KING: Yes, Frederic, from to-day you rank as a full-blown member of our band.
        
         <br>
         
         ALL:      Hurrah!
         
         <br>
         FREDERIC: My friends, I thank you all, from my heart, for your kindly wishes.  Would that I could repay them as they deserve!
         
         <br>
         
         KING: What do you mean?
         
         FREDERIC: To-day I am out of my indentures, and to-day I leave you for ever.

         <br>

         KING: But this is quite unaccountable; a keener hand at scuttling a Cunarder or cutting out a White Star never shipped a handspike.

         <br>

         FREDERIC: Yes, I have done my best for you.  And why?  It was my duty under my indentures, and I am the slave of duty.
                  As a child I was regularly apprenticed to your band. It was through an error — no matter, the mistake was ours,
                 not yours, and I was in honour bound by it.
        
         <br>
        
         SAMUEL:   An error?  What error?  (RUTH rises and comes forward)
         <br>
         
         FREDERIC: I may not tell you; it would reflect upon my well-loved Ruth.
         <br>
         RUTH: Nay, dear master, my mind has long been gnawed by the cankering tooth of mystery. Better have it out at once.

         RUTH:     Oh, pardon!  Frederic, pardon!  (Kneels)
         <br>
         FREDERIC: Rise, sweet one, I have long pardoned you.  
         <br>
         (Ruthrises)
         <br>
         RUTH:     The two words were so much alike!
         <br>
         FREDERIC: They were.  They still are, though years have rolled
            over their heads.  But this afternoon my obligation
            ceases.  Individually, I love you all with affection
            unspeakable; but, collectively, I look upon you with a
            disgust that amounts to absolute detestation.  Oh! pity
            me, my beloved friends, for such is my sense of duty
            that, once out of my indentures, I shall feel myself
            bound to devote myself heart and soul to your
            extermination!
         <br>
          ALL:      Poor lad — poor lad!  (All weep)
          <br>
          KING: Well, Frederic, if you conscientiously feel that it is your duty to destroy us, we cannot blame you for acting on that conviction.  Always act in accordance with the
            dictates of your conscience, my boy, and chance the consequences.
         <br>
          SAMUEL:   Besides, we can offer you but little temptation to remain with us.  We don't seem to make piracy pay.
                  I'm sure I don't know why, but we don't.
         <br>
          FREDERIC: I know why, but, alas! I mustn't tell you; it wouldn't be right.
          <br>
          KING: Why not, my boy?  It's only half-past eleven, and you are one of us until the clock strikes twelve.
          <br>
          SAMUEL:   True, and until then you are bound to protect our   interests.
          <br> 
          ALL:      Hear, hear!
          <br>
          FREDERIC: Well, then, it is my duty, as a pirate, to tell you that you are too tender-hearted.  For instance, you
            make a point of never attacking a weaker party than yourselves, and when you attack a stronger party you invariably get thrashed.
         <br> 
            KING:     There is some truth in that.
            <br>
            FREDERIC: Then, again, you make a point of never molesting an
            orphan!
            <br>
            SAMUEL:   Of course:  we are orphans ourselves, and know what it is.
            <br>
         FREDERIC: Yes, but it has got about, and what is the consequence? Every one we capture says he's an orphan.  The last
            three ships we took proved to be manned entirely by orphans, and so we had to let them go.  One would think
            that Great Britain's mercantile navy was recruited solely from her orphan asylums — which we know is not the case.
            <br>
            SAMUEL:   But, hang it all!  you wouldn't have us absolutely
            merciless?
            <br>
            FREDERIC: There's my difficulty; until twelve o'clock I would,
            after twelve I wouldn't.  Was ever a man placed in so
            delicate a situation?
