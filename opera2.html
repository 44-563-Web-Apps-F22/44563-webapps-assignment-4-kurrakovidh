       <h6 class="ALL"> ALL: </h6>  <p> Pour, O pour the pirate sherry; Fill, O fill the pirate glass; And, to make us more than merry Let the pirate bumper pass.</p>
               
        <h6 class="SAM">SAM:</h6> <p> For today our pirate 'prentice Rises from indentures freed; Strong his arm, and keen his scent is He's a pirate now indeed!</p>
         
        <h6 class="ALL">ALL:</h6>   <p>Here's good luck to Fred'ric's ventures! Fred'ric's out of his indentures. </p>
          
        <h6 class="SAM">SAM: </h6> <p>Two and twenty, now he's rising, And alone he's fit to fly,  Which we're bent on signalizing With unusual revelry.</p>

        <h6 class="FRE">FRE:</h6> <p>My friends, I thank you all, from my heart, for your kindly wishes.  Would that I could repay them as they deserve!</p>
         
        <h6 class="KIN"> KIN: </h6> <p> What do you mean?</p>
         
        <h6 class="FRE"> FRE:</h6> <p>To-day I am out of my indentures, and to-day I leave you for ever.</p>
        
        <h6 class="KIN">KIN:</h6> <p>But this is quite unaccountable; a keener hand at scuttling a Cunarder or cutting out a White Star never shipped a handspike.</p>
        
        <h6 class="FRE"> FRE:</h6> <p>Yes, I have done my best for you.  And why?  It was my duty under my indentures, and I am the slave of duty.
                 As a child I was regularly apprenticed to your band. It was through an error â€” no matter, the mistake was ours, not yours,
                 and I was in honour bound by it.</p>
        
        <h6 class="SAM">SAM: </h6> <p> An error?  What error? </p>

         <h6 class="FRE"> FRE:</h6> <p>I may not tell you; it would reflect upon my well-loved Ruth.</p>
